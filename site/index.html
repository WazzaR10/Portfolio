                <h5>
                    Indoguna Singapore is all about good food, good wine and good company.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    For over 20 years, we’ve been at the forefront of the food and beverage industry, dedicated to sourcing the finest the world has to offer and serving it to you.

                    Pursuing only the best – whether it’s meats, seafoods or boutique wines, we have everything you could wish for.

                    But that’s not all we can do. As a fully operational butchery, we offer value-added services such as meat and seafood value adding and portion control. It doesn’t stop there though. Understanding that passion for food means you only want the finest. Greengrocer.com.sg was started in 2007, to reach out to the home consumers who have a taste for quality produce.

                    Our philosophy as always – only the best is good enough.
                </p>

                <h5>Indoguna Singapore is also about standards, certifications and quality assurance.</h5>
                <p>
                    Our commitment to offer only the best quality produce to our customers is regularly evaluated & certified by independent bodies and government agencies (AVA Licence). Indoguna has also been assessed by Bureau Veritas Certification and conforms to the requirements of the Marine Stewardship Council standard for Chain of Custody, in the distribution of sustainable seafood.

                    Because we believe that a safe and healthy workplace is primordial in our business, we’ve enrolled in a 5-step programme with WHS council and thus been granted BizSAFE level 3.

                    In addition to the above, Indoguna is certified ISO 22301:2012 for Business Continuity Management System (BCM Certificate)
                </p>
                <h5>But that is not all that we are concerned about.</h5>
                <p>
                    Here at Indoguna, we care for the environment. Indoguna is committed to operate its business in an environmentally responsible manner.
